<h2>Artifact</h2>
This artifact is a poster for Korean Cultural & Speaking Tour in Asia-Pacific Europe ‘Sound of Liberation’. The concert was aimed at informing the world of a message that prayed for the unification of Korea and refused to be separately registered with the UN. It was a European concert tour to Luxembourg, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Ireland, France and United Kingdom.

A picture of a man hitting a Kkwaenggwari is drawn in the middle, and a picture of people dancing together is printed in a background. At the bottom of the drawing, it explains what kind of performance this concert is and what intention it planned with smaller texts. There is an empty space below, and since every time the country and city of the performance changed, it seems that they tried to write down a new address every time by hand.

<h3 id="division">Division</h3>
<p>The current division of the Korean Peninsula is the result of decisions taken at the end of World War II. In 1910, the Empire of Japan annexed Korea, and ruled over it until its defeat in World War II. The Korean independence agreement officially occurred on 1 December 1943, when the United States, China, and Great Britain signed the Cairo Declaration, which stated: “The aforesaid three powers, mindful of the enslavement of the people of Korea, are determined that in due course Korea shall become free and independent”. In 1945, the United Nations developed plans for trusteeship administration of Korea.<br>
The division of the peninsula into two military occupation zones was agreed – a northern zone administered by the Soviet Union and a southern zone administered by the United States. At midnight on 10 August 1945, two army lieutenant colonels selected the 38th parallel as a dividing line. Japanese troops to the North of this line were to surrender to the Soviet Union and troops to the South of this line would surrender to the United States. This was not originally intended to result in a long-lasting partition, but Cold War politics resulted in the establishment of two separate governments in the two zones in 1948 and rising tensions prevented cooperation. The desire of many Koreans for a peaceful unification was dashed when the Korean War broke out in 1950. In June 1950, troops from North Korea invaded South Korea. Mao Zedong encouraged the confrontation with the United States and Joseph Stalin reluctantly supported the invasion. After three years of fighting that involved both Koreas, China and United Nations forces led by the U.S., the war ended with an armistice agreement at approximately the same boundary.</p>
<h3 id="current-status">Current status</h3>
<p>The nature of unification, i.e. through North Korean collapse or gradual integration of the North and South, is still a topic of intense political debate and even conflict among interested parties, who include both Koreas, China, Japan, Russia, and the United States.<br>
Relations between the two Koreas have been strained in recent years, with provocative actions taken under the rule of Kim Jong-il (such as the suspected torpedoing of the ROKS Cheonan and the bombardment of Yeonpyeong Island) and his son, Kim Jong-un (such as the rocket launches in April and December of 2012 and North Korea’s third nuclear test). Kim Jong-un’s sudden accession and limited experience governing have also stoked fears about power struggles among different factions leading to future instability on the Korean Peninsula.<br>
Reunification remains a long-term goal for the governments of both North and South Korea. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un made calls in his 2012 New Year’s Day speech to “remove confrontation” between the two countries and implement previous joint agreements for increased economic and political cooperation. The South Korean Ministry of Unification redoubled their efforts in 2011 and 2012 to raise awareness of the issue, launching a variety show (Miracle Audition) and an Internet sitcom with pro-unification themes. The Ministry already promotes curriculum in elementary schooling, such as a government-issued textbook about North Korea titled “We Are One” and reunification-themed arts and crafts projects.<br>
In Kim Jong-Un’s 2018 New Year’s address, a Korean-led reunification was repeatedly mentioned and an unexpected proposal was made for the North’s participation in the 2018 Winter Olympics that were held in Pyeongchang County of South Korea, a significant shift after several years of increasing hostilities. Subsequent meetings between North and South led to the announcement that the two Koreas would march together with a unified flag in the Olympics’ Opening Ceremony and form a unified ice hockey team, with a total of 22 North Korean athletes participating in various other competitions including figure skating, short track speed skating, cross-country skiing and alpine skiing.<br>
In April 2018, at a summit in Panmunjom, Kim Jong-un and Moon Jae-in signed a deal committing to finally seal peace between both Koreas by the end of the year. Both leaders also symbolically crossed each other’s borders, marking it the first time a South Korean president cross the North border and vice versa. Kim stated that the North will start a process of denuclearization, which is supported by the U.S. President Donald Trump.</p>
<h3 id="opposition">Opposition</h3>
<p>Support for reunification in South Korea has been falling, especially among the younger generations. In the 1990s, the percent of people in government polls who regarded reunification as essential was over 80%. By 2011 that number had dropped to 56%.<br>
According to a December 2017 survey released by the Korea Institute for National Unification, 72.1% of South Koreans in their 20s believe reunification is unnecessary, with younger South Koreans saying they are more worried about issues related to their economy, employment, and living costs.<br>
Polls show a majority of South Koreans, even those in age groups traditionally seen as being more eager to reunify the peninsula, are not willing to see their living condition suffer in order to accommodate the North. Moreover, about 50% of men in their 20s see North Korea as an outright enemy that they want nothing to do with. Some scholars, like Paul Roderick Gregory, have suggested that a complete abandonment of Korean reunification may be necessary, in exchange for the North to dismantle its nuclear weapons program and permanently ending the Korean War with a peace treaty.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/zHQl4uo.png" alt="enter image description here" width="500px"></p>
<p>The “Last Fugitive” involved in the May 18th Gwangju People’s Uprising of 1980, and a central initiator of the progressive Korean American grassroots movement.<br>
He is widely recognized by the overseas Korean American movement and the human rights and social justice movement in South Korea as a critical, astute and eloquent political leader.</p>
<p>In Los Angeles and the United States, Yoon Han Bong challenged and motivated many young Korean Americans to combine their passion and awareness of injustice with practical skills in organizing, education and movement building.</p>
<p>Upon Yoon’s arrival in the United States, he focused on building an overseas solidarity movement to support the democracy movement in South Korea. Among his accomplishments are the founding of the Korean Resource Center in 1983, Young Koreans United (YKU=한청련) in 1984 and the Korean Alliance for Peace and Justice of USA in 1987. YKU spawned the formation of grassroots community-based organizations throughout the country including the Korean American Resource &amp; Cultural Center in Chicago, YKASEC – Empowering the Korean American Community in New York City and the National Korean American Service &amp; Education Consortium (NAKASEC).</p>
<p>“Unless there are not big variables, our homeland will be separately admitted to the UN in this year. This issue has many conditions that we cannot be fought against with all our’s might. <strong>However, we are responsible for informing many other countries that are solidarity about the issue of separation.</strong> In the meantime, we have always been in the position of one country but if we do not strongly protest the situation in which two countries are recognized separately, it becomes an international laughing matter. Let’s do the best propaganda activities we can. <strong>This is our own way to keep our dignity of National Democratic Movement.</strong>"</p>

## Transcoding
Even though we were born and raised in South Korea, we have never learned about the effort of overseas Koreans for Korean Reunification at school. Thus, we were surprised to find out that there were actually so many organizations that worked for the peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula. Therefore, we felt the necessity of remembrance of their work and effort, and decided to set our concept for transcoding as a memorial tool. In short, it can be described in two keywords: **Unison** & **Oral tradition**. Our transcoding consits of two different tools; *Peace by Piece* -- a puzzle website --  and  *We Are One* -- a karaoke website.

## Peace by Piece

### Description
With this transcoding tool, we aimed to build a memorial in respect of visual aspect. It is a platform where people can join to complete a puzzle, piece by piece in realtime. 

### Methods
Using the visual materials from our previous research, we generated the design of the puzzle. For the technical part, we used the code provided by Raymond Hill as an opensource. (Link - [http://www.raymondhill.net/puzzle-rhill/jigsawpuzzle-rhill.php](http://www.raymondhill.net/puzzle-rhill/jigsawpuzzle-rhill.php)) We edited html, css and javascript from the original code.

### Tools

Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Atom.

### Results

Still in process

## We Are One

### Description

With this transcoding tool, we aimed to build a memorial platform in respect of verbal/oral aspect. It is a karaoke platform where people can record their own poetry reading of 'One Country' and store it on the website.

### Methods

This includes the coding languages, coding frameworks or libraries, and any platforms or webtools for example.

### Results

The coding tool will vary a lot between different students. So depending on the use and type, you may include more or less documentation here.

### Source Links

Please include links to the tools, sources etc used during the coding. E.g. the resources used for making your coding tool.
